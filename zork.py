    A 5x5 neighborhood of houses has a problem. People have turned into
    horrible monsters. Your goal is to transform all monsters back to 
    people by throwing different types of candy at them to bring them 
    (your weapons). The weapons have different attack multipliers. Some 
    monsters are weak against certain types of candy, while immune to
    other types. You, as well as all npcs, have a certain amount of
    health (hitpoints) and attack level. You must clear a house of all 
    monsters before moving to a different house. Use 'w' to go north 
    one house, 'a' to go west, 'd' to go east, and 's' to go south.
